    </b> was an orphan who became a pupil of Hiruzen Sarutobi alongside Jiraiya and Tsunade. Compared to the more laid
    back Jiraiya, Orochimaru stood out as a genius — his talents, insight, and determination were considered by Hiruzen
    to be that of a prodigy seen only once in a generation. According to Tsunade, Orochimaru had a twisted personality
    even as a child. His sadistic attitude was presumably due to the death of his parents. At some point after losing
    them, Orochimaru found a white snake near his parents' grave, with Hiruzen's explanation of it representing fortune
    and rebirth inspiring Orochimaru to study kinjutsu and obtain knowledge of all techniques. Jiraiya theorised that
    Orochimaru went down this path in an attempt to forget his painful memories.</div>
